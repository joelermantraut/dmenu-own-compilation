# dmenu own compilation

This is my own dmenu compilation, which includes:

 - Mouse Support.
 - Multi-Selection.
 - Scrolling.
 - Fuzzy Match.
 - Height Parameter.

# Description

Dmenu (from dynamic menu) is a simple but useful tool developed by
the people of [suckless.org](https://suckless.org/).

You can download the [basic installation](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/), and to add some of the
functionalities (and many more) that I have in this repository, you have to download
patches, install them and then compile Dmenu. You can learn more
about it in [Dmenu home page](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/).

With this repository, if you only (on initially) want to use the previously mentioned functionalities, you don't need
to do all the compile process. It will be ready if you follow "Usage" section instructions.

# Usage

This is ready to compile and install, so run:

```c
make && sudo make install
```

And you can start using it.
